-- Query 1 --
-- Which factors contribute the most to happiness across the world? By region? --

-- Key takeaway: family is more important in 2015, and 2017, but dips below GDP in 2016 as most important.

FROM project_data
GROUP BY region;

-- Key Takeaway: as GDP increases in regions, GDP starts to matter more. In other words, developed, high economy
-- countires value their wealth more than developing countries who value family. 

-- Query 2 --
-- How much does money (GDP) matter in contribution to happiness? --

-- Key Takeaway: The happiest countries fall toward the center of the GDP to happiness ratios, indicating that
-- money does "buy happiness" but it doesn't continue to matter as much as one might think.

-- How do the world powers compare in happiness trend to the rest of the world from 2016 to 2017? --
